# Demo: web client for matrix-files-sdk

[Live demo](https://vector-im.github.io/files-sdk-demo/)

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
yarn install
```

...then start:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001). You should see the app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). 
If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will output a set of files into the `dist` folder which can then be deployed to a CDN or web server.
